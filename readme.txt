In this small project I estimate price movement of electricity wholesale prices in one particular region in New Zealand by applying ARIMA. I used the same methodology as in my Bachelor's thesis ("Energy Performance Contracting in Russia: A Real Options Approach on Project Valuation") where I had to estimate the price movement in the Russian electricity wholesale market with MATLAB. This time, however, I used R for this purpose, generating an HTML report using R markdown.

The purpose of this project is to explore the possibilities and advantages of R for time series analysis.

Required packages to run the codes and to reproduce the solution:

- tseries
- forecast
- ggplot2
- anytime
- here
